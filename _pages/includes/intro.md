I am a third-year Master's student in the Department of Computer Science and Technology at Zhejiang University, under the supervision of Professor [Zhou Zhao](https://person.zju.edu.cn/zhaozhou). I completed my bachelor's degree in the same department. 

My research focuses on Multi-modal Learning, 3D Scene Understanding, and Embodied AI. Currently, I am researching the multi-modal perception and reasoning capabilities of robotic policies during my internship at OpenRobotLab, advised by Yilun Chen and led by Jiangmiao Pang.
