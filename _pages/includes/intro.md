I am a first-year Ph.D. student in Computer Science at Iowa State University, supervised by Professor [Yang Li](https://jerryyangli.github.io/). I earned my M.S. and B.Eng. in Computer Science from Zhejiang University, where I was advised by Professor [Zhou Zhao](https://scholar.google.com.hk/citations?user=IIoFY90AAAAJ&hl=en). My research focuses on Multimodal Learning, Large Language Models, and Computer Vision.

<!-- Currently, I am researching to enhance multi-modal perception and reasoning capabilities for robot policies during my internship at [OpenRobotLab](https://github.com/OpenRobotLab), advised by [Yilun Chen](https://yilunchen.com/about/) and [Jiangmiao Pang](https://oceanpang.github.io/). -->
