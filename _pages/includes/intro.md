I am a first-year Ph.D. student at Iowa State University. I completed M.S. and B.S. degrees in the [College of Computer Science and Technology](http://www.en.cs.zju.edu.cn/) at Zhejiang University, under the supervision of Professor [Zhou Zhao](https://scholar.google.com.hk/citations?user=IIoFY90AAAAJ&hl=en). My research focuses on 3D/2D Computer Vision and Multi-modal Learning.

<!-- Currently, I am researching to enhance multi-modal perception and reasoning capabilities for robot policies during my internship at [OpenRobotLab](https://github.com/OpenRobotLab), advised by [Yilun Chen](https://yilunchen.com/about/) and [Jiangmiao Pang](https://oceanpang.github.io/). -->
