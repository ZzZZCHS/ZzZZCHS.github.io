I am a third-year Master's student in the [College of Computer Science and Technology](http://www.en.cs.zju.edu.cn/) at Zhejiang University, under the supervision of Professor [Zhou Zhao](https://person.zju.edu.cn/zhaozhou). I also completed my Bachelor's degree at Zhejiang University.

My research focuses on Multi-modal Learning, 3D Scene Understanding, and Embodied AI. Currently, I am researching to enhance multi-modal perception and reasoning capabilities for robot policies during my internship at [OpenRobotLab](https://github.com/OpenRobotLab), advised by [Yilun Chen](https://yilunchen.com/about/) and led by [Jiangmiao Pang](https://oceanpang.github.io/).
